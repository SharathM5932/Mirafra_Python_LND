Check location for product delivery
Usually online grocery, vegetable, fruit and food delivery stores have to check for location reachability in 1 or 2 days. Because if the quick delivery is not possible, customer may no longer need the product.
Now as a precaution, write a program which will ask the customer to enter the full address(with or without postal code) or just city name which will help online shop to reach the customer in time. 
Store some city names along with its postal pin code which will act as your database. If the city name is not preset in the database, display  a sorry message. If the city name is preset in the database display its pin code and a suitable message along with it.
