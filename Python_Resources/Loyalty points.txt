Loyalty points
Aadarsh works for billing department as cashier or counter boy in ABC store. Now a new offer has been announced that cashback on loyalty points. The offer is simple that if the customer is shopping for Rs. 100 he/she will get 1 loyalty point. For 2 points they have to bill Rs. 200 not less than that. If the customer earns 100 loyalty points they will get Rs. 100 cash back i.e. reduction in billing. 
A coupon can also win loyalty points. If the customer has the coupon with code ‘123476’ they can win 20 loyalty points.
Some of the customers are regular to ABC store who’s name are available in database along with their priorly earned loyalty points. If the customer is new to ABC store based on the bill amount and coupon Aadarsh has to calculate loyalty points. If the customer’s name is there in database then, their priorly earned loyalty points should be added along with their current bill and coupon if any, and give them cashback. The remaining loyalty points should be displayed as message.
Now write a piece of code which will ask the bill amount and coupon code which Aadarsh has to enter and check to cash back offer.
