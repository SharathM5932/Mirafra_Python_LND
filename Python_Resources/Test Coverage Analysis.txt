Test Coverage Analysis is a process of evaluating the extent to which your tests cover the codebase. It helps to identify which parts of the code are tested and which parts remain untested. The goal is to improve the quality of the testing process by ensuring all code paths and components are adequately tested. Test coverage is typically represented as a percentage, where a higher percentage indicates more code is covered by tests.

Types of Coverage Metrics:
Line Coverage: Measures the percentage of executable lines of code that are executed by tests.
Branch Coverage: Measures whether each branch (e.g., in if statements) has been executed during the tests.
Function Coverage: Measures whether each function in the code is called during the tests.
