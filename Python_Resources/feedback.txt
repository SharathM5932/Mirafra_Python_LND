Feedback
A online selling shop wants to store all the feedbacks on every product from its customers. So that, it can decide weather to sale that product in their site or not. 
Being a developer write a program which will ask the customer’s name, product name and feedback and prints thank you message at last. Based on the product name a file should be created if not there and with the customer’s name the feedback should be stored into the file. If the product’s named file already exists it should just add the current feedback to that file itself.
