Starting with Python 3.3, and continuing to Python current version, you can create a package without an __init__.py file. This is possible due to the introduction of namespace packages as part of PEP 420. However, whether to omit the __init__.py file depends on the use case and your specific needs.

Significance of __init__.py

Marks a Directory as a Package:
The presence of an __init__.py file in a directory signals to Python that the directory should be treated as a package.
Without __init__.py, Python (before version 3.3) would not recognize the directory as a package.

Controls Package Initialization:
When a package is imported, the code inside __init__.py is executed first.
It can be used to initialize variables, import submodules, or execute any setup code required for the package.

Facilitates Importing Specific Components:
By defining an __all__ variable, you can control what gets imported when from package import * is used.

Acts as a Central Location for Exports:
You can use __init__.py to define shortcuts for commonly used modules or functions within the package.
This simplifies imports for users of the package.

Backward Compatibility:
While __init__.py is not strictly required in Python 3.3 and later (due to implicit namespace packages), it is still widely used for backward compatibility and explicitness.

#Create a folder with 3 files
my_package/
    __init__.py
    module1.py
    module2.py
.........................
#module1.py
def greet():
    return "Hello from module1!"
.............
#module2.py
def farewell():
    return "Goodbye from module2!"
............
#__init__.py
from .module1 import greet
from .module2 import farewell
.............
#main.py
import my_package

print(my_package.greet())      # Output: Hello from module1!
print(my_package.farewell())   # Output: Goodbye from module2!
.......................

Using __all__ for Controlled Imports
#__init__.py:
from .module1 import greet
from .module2 import farewell

__all__ = ["greet"]  # Only `greet` will be imported with `from my_package import *`
..................
#main.py
from my_package import *
print(greet())      # Output: Hello from module1!
# print(farewell())  # Raises NameError: name 'farewell' is not defined
