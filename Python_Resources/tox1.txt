Introduction to Tox:

The full form of Tox is "Testing OX". The term "OX" doesn't have a specific meaning but is generally used as a reference to emphasize testing in a versatile, cross-environment manner. 
Tox is a tool primarily used for automating testing in Python projects. It allows you to easily test your code across multiple environments, including different Python versions and configurations. Tox automates the setup, execution, and teardown of test environments, ensuring consistency and reproducibility in testing. Its role in automation testing is crucial for ensuring your code works seamlessly across various setups and dependencies.

Installation and Setup: 
pip install tox

Example of a simple tox.ini file:

[tox]
envlist = py36, py37, py38  # Defines Python versions to test against

[testenv]
deps =
    pytest  # Specifies dependencies for testing
commands =
    pytest  # Command to run the tests
.........................
or
..........
[tox]
envlist = py36, py37

[testenv:py36]
deps =
    pytest
    requests

[testenv:py37]
deps =
    pytest
    requests
    flake8
